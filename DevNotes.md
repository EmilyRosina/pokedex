## Inital ideas
#### Use Spotify API to search for relevant playlists, then route to page showcasing all playlist's tracks etc
_only problem being that I would need to setup OAuth and integrate jwt, tokens etc - bit too much for 4 hrs.._
#### Use dummy data to populate some Spotify and/or other interesting things
_problem being need to find interesting things in some kind of form that isn't too hard to digest via JSON_
#### Pokémon! Easy pics, branding etc.
_and yes!! Found non-auth end points via a very kind and thoughtful human, this should work nicely!_
#### Ooh I could add the trading card images from another API too... maybe...
_from this API [Pokémon TCG](https://docs.pokemontcg.io/#api_v1cards_list)_

## Problems encountered
|problem|solution|
|-------|--------|
|images.. hmm..|ah, ok - so Pokéapi does have sprites.. just got to weedle them down a bit xD geddit?|
|images again.. but caching|keep stash of 1 lot of images, but fetch others on request when on individual pokemon page|



## If I had more time...
