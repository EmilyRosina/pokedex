## Inital ideas
#### üí° Use Spotify API to search for relevant playlists, then route to page showcasing all playlist's tracks etc
> _only problem being that I would need to setup OAuth and integrate jwt, tokens etc - bit too much for 4 hrs.._
#### üí° Use dummy data to populate some Spotify and/or other interesting things
> _problem being need to find interesting things in some kind of form that isn't too hard to digest via JSON_
#### üí° Pok√©mon! Easy pics, branding etc.
> _and yes!! Found non-auth end points via a very kind and thoughtful human, this should work nicely!_
#### üí° Ooh I could add the trading card images from another API too... maybe...
> _from this API [Pok√©mon TCG](https://docs.pokemontcg.io/#api_v1cards_list)_

## Problems encountered
|problem|solution|
|-------|--------|
|images.. hmm..|ah, ok - so Pok√©api does have sprites.. just got to weedle them down a bit xD geddit?|
|images again.. but caching|keep stash of 1 lot of images, but fetch others on request when on individual pokemon page|



## If I had more time...
#### ‚≠ê make UI look more like this...
